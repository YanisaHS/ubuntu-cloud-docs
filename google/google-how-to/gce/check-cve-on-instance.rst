Check if your Ubuntu image has addressed a CVE
==============================================

To determine if an Ubuntu instance running on GCP has addressed a specific CVE, you can use the `Ubuntu OVAL`_ tooling developed by Canonical's security team.

You'll need SSH (or some command line) access to the instance, to follow the instructions given below.


Install the required packages
-----------------------------

Install the required packages - bzip2 (to uncompress the OVAL data) and `OpenSCAP`_ (to scan the instance):

.. code::

    sudo apt update && sudo apt install libopenscap8 bzip2 -y


Scan the instance
------------------

The commands used to scan the instance vary slightly based on whether your instance is running Ubuntu or Ubuntu Pro.

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Ubuntu

        The following commands will:

        #. Retrieve the name of the Ubuntu release running on your instance
        #. Download the CVE OVAL feed for that release
        #. Extract the XML file from the downloaded archive
        #. Scan the instance, i.e. use the ``oscap`` tool to run an OVAL evaluation with the downloaded OVAL feed

        .. code::

            export $(cat /etc/os-release | grep UBUNTU_CODENAME)
            wget "https://security-metadata.canonical.com/oval/com.ubuntu.${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml.bz2"
            bunzip2 "com.ubuntu.${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml.bz2"
            oscap oval eval --report report.html "com.ubuntu.${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml"


    .. tab:: Ubuntu Pro

        Since an Ubuntu Pro instance is configured with `ESM`_ apt repositories in addition to the default main repository, ``apt`` will try to download packages from an ESM repository. If it can't find the package there, it will fallback to the main repository. So you need to download and merge the OVAL feeds of both the repositories before running a scan.

        To merge the OVAL feeds, use ``oval-xml-feed-merge``, which can be installed by running:

        .. code::

            sudo snap install oval-xml-feed-merge

        The following commands will:

        #. Retrieve the name of the Ubuntu release running on your instance
        #. Download the CVE OVAL feed for the ESM repositories of that release
        #. Extract the XML file (ESM related) from the downloaded archive
        #. Download the CVE OVAL feed for the main repositories of that release
        #. Extract the XML file (main related) from the downloaded archive
        #. Merge the two XML files 

        .. code::

            export $(cat /etc/os-release | grep UBUNTU_CODENAME)
            wget "https://security-metadata.canonical.com/oval/com.ubuntu.esm-apps_${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml.bz2"
            bunzip2 "com.ubuntu.esm-apps_${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml.bz2"
            wget "https://security-metadata.canonical.com/oval/com.ubuntu.${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml.bz2"
            bunzip2 "com.ubuntu.${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml.bz2"
            oval-xml-feed-merge --verbose "com.ubuntu.${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml" "com.ubuntu.esm-apps_${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml" --output "com.ubuntu.${UBUNTU_CODENAME}-pro.cve.oval.xml" # The order of filenames in this command is important

        The merge tool can only access the home directory, so the OVAL feeds have to be downloaded there. Also, the merging can take a few minutes if you are running an instance with a conservative CPU configuration.

        
        If you are running a release older than five years, run the following commands instead to download and merge the OVAL feeds.

        .. code::

            export $(cat /etc/os-release | grep UBUNTU_CODENAME)
            wget "https://security-metadata.canonical.com/oval/com.ubuntu.esm-apps_${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml.bz2"
            bunzip2 "com.ubuntu.esm-apps_${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml.bz2"
            wget "https://security-metadata.canonical.com/oval/com.ubuntu.esm-infra_${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml.bz2"
            bunzip2 "com.ubuntu.esm-infra_${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml.bz2"
            wget "https://security-metadata.canonical.com/oval/com.ubuntu.${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml.bz2"
            bunzip2 "com.ubuntu.${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml.bz2"
            oval-xml-feed-merge --verbose "com.ubuntu.${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml" "com.ubuntu.esm-infra_${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml" "com.ubuntu.esm-apps_${UBUNTU_CODENAME}.cve.oval.xml" --output "com.ubuntu.${UBUNTU_CODENAME}-pro.cve.oval.xml" # The order of filenames in this command is important

        Finally,

        7. Run the scans

        .. code::

            oscap oval eval --report report.html "com.ubuntu.${UBUNTU_CODENAME}-pro.cve.oval.xml"


Download the scan report
------------------------

You can download the report from the instance to your local machine using the gcloud CLI. Assuming you ran ``oval eval`` in the home directory of a user named "ubuntu_user" on an instance named "ubuntu-instance", the command to download the report is:

.. code::

    gcloud compute scp ubuntu_user@ubuntu-instance:report.html .

You'll find ``report.html`` in the directory where you executed the command, and if you open it in a browser you'll see something similar to: 

.. image:: check-cve-on-instance-images/0_oscap_oval_cve_scan_report.png
   :align: center

You can check the *Reference ID* column of the results table for the specific CVE that you are interested in. The colour code indicates if the CVE is addressed on your instance in its current state. A green row indicates an addressed CVE while an amber one indicates otherwise.
